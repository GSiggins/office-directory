### Tools used: 
- Node, FS, Jest, Inquirer, and Bootstrap

### Workflow: 
- Init begins inquirer prompts

- Prompts use constructors and subclass constructors to create manager, engineer, and intern subclasses.

- All objects constructed get pushed to an array.

- Array is then sent to function to deconstruct and build HTML cards based on what class was constructed. 

- HTML cards are sent to an array which is then passed into a template literal as the result of the function called within the template literal. 

- The template literal creates the HTML structure, including the created cards, with appropriate styling, to be displayed on the page.
